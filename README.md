implementing some sorting algorithms in python

my quicksort_2.py algorithm was inspired by the code found here: 
http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/pythonds/SortSearch/TheQuickSort.html

My quicksort.py was just my first (and rushed) attempt at writing the algorithm, before i put much thought into it.
It works, but its not as clean as the other. 

mergesort.py is my implimentation of the mergesort algorithm, but it uses splicing and therefore is less efficient. 

TO DO: 
- make my quicksort algorithm have the option of taking the median-of-three as a pivot
(currently, the pivot is always just the element in the most leftward position)
- get rid of splicing in my mergesort algorithm (i'll just need to manual keep track of the indices)
